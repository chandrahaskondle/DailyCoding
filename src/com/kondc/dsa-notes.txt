Recursion:
A function calling itself until a base condition is meet.
There are 2 ways you do recursion generally,
    - functional (uses return statement)
    - parameterized (pass all inputs, results in params)

Stack(call stack) space - include it in the space complexity

Backtracking:
This is an algorithm technique to solve a problem, you will go down and eliminate
the wrong sets and continue recursion.
