Redis vs Memcached:
---------
Redis
- has datatypes
- master/slave architecture
- supports data persistence (2 different ways - RDB snapshot & AOF log)
- has 6 diff types of algorithms for cache invalidation

- regex search is possible in Redis (but not suggested in prod as it increases repsonse time)

nosql vs mysql
--------
1) diff types of nosql db
2) why mysql doesnt shard well when compared to nosql ?
	- Your db will be normalized (atleast 3NF). After partitions in mysql db,
	 	when you need list of courses attended by a user, you want to perform a join with another table.
	 	That join should be done across the servers.
	 	Suggested way is to deNormalise you db as much as possible for paritioning the db
3) For consistent systems, mysql is preferred. Why ?
