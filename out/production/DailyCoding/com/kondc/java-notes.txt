Points:

Interfaces:
- all methods are public static by default
- all fields are public static final by default
- From java 8, Interfaces can have default & static methods.



acquiring lock
    - Object level locking => synchronized(this) block, synchronized method
    - Class level locking => synchronized(ClassName.class) block, synchronized static method

Dependency Injection: is a design pattern
	- is a way of injecting dependencies of a object.

	- benefits
		- (Loosly coupled application) Inside a class we use new keyword to create dependency.
			This is bad design pattern as the signature or dependencies of the class may change,
			and so we have to change intializaton in all classes.
		- ease of testing the classes
		- seperation of conserns, extensibilty
